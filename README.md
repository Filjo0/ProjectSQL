Note: This project needs to be refactored to use best practices which will be done later. As of now this code should be used only for understanding purposes.

Note: Run individual test cases instead of running all the test cases together to understand better. Comment non related annotations and uncomment required annotations by refering the test case and entity class so that you will not get confused.
